## Project title  
**Fertility Rate Analysis: Caribbean Region (1950 – 2023)**

---

## Analysis summary  
This analysis examines fertility rate trends across 14 Caribbean nations from 1950 to 2023, revealing a dramatic regional demographic shift from an average of ~5.5 children per woman to ~1.7 - well below the 2.1 replacement level needed to maintain stable populations.

---

## Key findings  

- **Haiti stands out** – it’s the only country still above replacement level (2.656 vs the 2.1 threshold)  
- **Haiti started highest** (6.3) and dropped least in percentage terms – went from 6.3 to 2.7  
- **Jamaica had the lowest fertility rate in 2023**, seeing it go from 3.923 in 1950 to 1.358 in 2023  
- **Most islands at the end of 2023 are clustered around 1.4-1.7 births per woman** – Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados, Cuba all ended up in similar range

## Implications
This below-replacement fertility suggests most Caribbean nations will face aging populations and potential labor shortages in coming decades, with Haiti being the notable exception.
